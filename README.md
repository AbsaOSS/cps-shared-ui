## Consumer Products UI Kit

#### Shared components library

This repository consists of two projects:

- cps-ui-kit - shared components library itself
- composition - application for previewing compositions of components consumed from the library

## Development server

Run `ng build cps-ui-kit --watch` and `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
